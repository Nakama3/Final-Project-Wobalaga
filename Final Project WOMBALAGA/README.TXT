BACKSTORY: Far into the future, Marsupials had finally taken over the solar system. With their technologically advanced pouches, humans could not stop them in their furry democratic control of the newly founded Marsupial Space Republic. After years of peace, after all humans had been eradicated, a new threat the to the MSR emerged: sea creatures. The sea creatures had overpopulated the depths of earth's oceans and desired more living space, but the marsupials were in their way. After a full force surprise attack the new Space Sea Creature Legion destroyed all marsupials but a few wombats who had been spared for use as slaves. The SSCL's communist regime had thrived for many years until one wombat took it upon himself to restore balance to the solar system. Jaxon escaped slavery after a daring escape, stealing a SSCL model Spear Fisher space craft with a few wombat buddies at his side. You must help Jaxon and his wombat crew fight the SSCL and restore the Marsupial Space Republic as the fair controller of the solar system. Good luck!
