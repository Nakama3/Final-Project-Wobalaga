VERSION or DATE: 6/12/17

AUTHORS: Kanoa, Neesha, Noelle, Gavin

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: open the greenfoot file in the Final Project WOMBALAGA folder (must have greenfoot downloaded on computer to run this program).

USER INSTRUCTIONS: Left and right arrow keys to move, space bar to shoot. Don't get hit by the fish bullets! They will destroy you. You have three lives.

BACKSTORY: Far into the future, Marsupials had finally taken over the solar system. With their technologically advanced pouches, humans could not stop them in their furry democratic control of the newly founded Marsupial Space Republic. After years of peace, after all humans had been eradicated, a new threat the to the MSR emerged: sea creatures. The sea creatures had overpopulated the depths of earth's oceans and desired more living space, but the marsupials were in their way. After a full force surprise attack the new Space Sea Creature Legion destroyed all marsupials but a few wombats who had been spared for use as slaves. The SSCL's communist regime had thrived for many years until one wombat took it upon himself to restore balance to the solar system. Jaxon escaped slavery after a daring escape, stealing a SSCL model Spear Fisher space craft with a few wombat buddies at his side. You must help Jaxon and his wombat crew fight the SSCL and restore the Marsupial Space Republic as the fair controller of the solar system. Good luck! 




MOVING BACKGROUND OPTION: There is a gif background added into the program however it causes greenfoot to crash due to there not being enough memory allocated to it. If you allocate more memory you can add the Space actor by right clicking on it and adding a new one and putting it on top of the screen in place of the original background (it will look exactly the same). Do this while the game is paused. Then resume the game and you should have a moving background! Your game may still crash after this, if it does just reset it and the background won't be moving anymore.
